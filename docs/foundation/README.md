# Foundation Models

## üî¨ Overview

The foundation models category represents the seminal works that established the feed-forward 3D reconstruction paradigm. These papers introduced key innovations that moved the field from traditional iterative methods (SfM + MVS) to end-to-end learnable approaches.

## üìà Research Timeline

```
2022: CroCo     - Cross-view completion pretraining
2023: CroCo v2  - Enhanced stereo and optical flow
2024: DUSt3R    - End-to-end 3D reconstruction ‚≠ê
2024: MASt3R    - 3D-aware feature matching
2024: MASt3R-SfM - Complete SfM pipeline
```

## üéØ Key Innovations

1. **Self-supervised Pretraining** (CroCo, CroCo v2)
   - Cross-view completion as pretext task
   - No need for 3D ground truth annotations
   - Effective representation learning for downstream tasks

2. **Feed-forward 3D Reconstruction** (DUSt3R)
   - Direct regression of 3D pointmaps
   - Confidence-aware predictions
   - Works with uncalibrated images

3. **3D-aware Feature Matching** (MASt3R)
   - Integrates geometric understanding into matching
   - Improved accuracy over traditional feature matching
   - Enables robust multi-view reconstruction

4. **Complete SfM Pipeline** (MASt3R-SfM)
   - End-to-end trainable structure from motion
   - Handles unordered image collections
   - Competitive with traditional pipelines

## üí° Impact on the Field

These foundation models have:
- **Democratized 3D reconstruction** by removing the need for calibration
- **Accelerated research** with readily available pretrained models
- **Enabled new applications** in robotics, AR/VR, and content creation
- **Inspired 50+ follow-up papers** in just 2 years

## üöÄ Getting Started

```python
# Quick start with DUSt3R
from dust3r.inference import inference
from dust3r.model import AsymmetricCroCo3DStereo

# Load pretrained model
model = AsymmetricCroCo3DStereo.from_pretrained("naver/DUSt3R_ViTLarge_BaseDecoder_512_dpt")

# Run inference on image pairs
output = inference([(img1, img2)], model)
```
