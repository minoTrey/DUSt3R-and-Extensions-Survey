*MASt3R grounds image matching in 3D space, unifying dense correspondence with geometric reconstruction*

## 📋 Overview
- **Authors**: Vincent Leroy, Yohann Cabon, Jérôme Revaud
- **Institution**: NAVER LABS Europe
- **Venue**: ECCV 2024
- **Links**: [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09756) | [Code](https://github.com/naver/mast3r) | [Project Page](https://dust3r.europe.naverlabs.com/)
- **TL;DR**: Extends DUSt3R with 3D-aware dense feature matching, treating correspondence as an inherently 3D problem rather than 2D.

## 🎯 Key Contributions

1. **3D-Aware Matching**: First method to treat image matching as a 3D problem, directly linked to camera pose and scene geometry
2. **Unified Framework**: Combines accurate feature matching with robust 3D reconstruction in a single model
3. **Fast Reciprocal Matching**: Novel matching scheme that's orders of magnitude faster with theoretical guarantees
4. **Dense Local Features**: Adds descriptor head to DUSt3R architecture for precise correspondences
5. **Metric Outputs**: Natively produces metric 3D reconstructions while establishing pixel correspondences

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Base**: Built on DUSt3R's transformer framework
- **Encoder**: ViT-Large (same as DUSt3R)
- **Decoder**: ViT-Base (same as DUSt3R)
