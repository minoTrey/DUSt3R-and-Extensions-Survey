# Medical and Specialized Applications

## üè• Overview

The Medical and Specialized Applications category showcases adaptations of DUSt3R for domain-specific challenges, particularly in medical imaging and endoscopy. These papers address unique constraints such as dynamic deformable tissues, limited texture, challenging lighting conditions, and the need for real-time performance in surgical settings.

## üìà Research Focus

```
Medical adaptations address:
- Monocular endoscopic video reconstruction
- Dynamic surgical scenes with deformable tissues
- Real-time requirements for intraoperative guidance
