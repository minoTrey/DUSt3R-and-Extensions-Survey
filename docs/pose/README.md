# Pose Estimation Papers

This category includes papers that focus on camera pose estimation and visual localization, leveraging the DUSt3R foundation for efficient and accurate pose prediction.

## Papers in this Category

### [Reloc3r](reloc3r.md)
**CVPR 2025** - Large-scale pose regression framework achieving 40 FPS localization with strong generalization.

### [Pos3R](pos3r.md) 
**CVPR 2025** - Zero-shot 6D object pose estimation using 3D foundation models. *(Documentation coming soon)*

## Overview

The pose estimation category represents specialized applications of DUSt3R's geometric understanding for camera and object pose prediction. These methods typically:

- Trade full 3D reconstruction for specialized pose estimation
- Achieve real-time or near real-time performance
- Leverage large-scale training for generalization
- Enable practical applications in AR/VR, robotics, and SLAM

## Key Trends

1. **Scale**: Training on millions of image pairs
2. **Speed**: Real-time performance (30+ FPS)
3. **Generalization**: Working across diverse scene types
4. **Simplification**: Streamlined architectures for deployment
