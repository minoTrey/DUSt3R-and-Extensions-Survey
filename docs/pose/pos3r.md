## 🔧 Technical Details

### Core Innovation: 3D Foundation for Pose
```
Traditional: Train per object category → Limited generalization
Pos3R: 3D foundation model → Works on any object
```

### Technical Approach

#### 1. 3D Foundation Model Integration
- Leverages pre-trained 3D reconstruction foundation models
- Uses DUSt3R-based architecture for 3D-consistent features
- Exploits foundation models' better 3D understanding
- No additional pose-specific training required

#### 2. Template Selection Innovation
```
Problem: 2D models struggle with template pose selection
Solution: 3D models naturally distinguish between poses
Result: More accurate initial pose estimates
```

#### 3. Key Components
- **3D Feature Extraction**: From foundation model
- **Template Matching**: In 3D-aware feature space
- **Pose Estimation**: Direct from matched templates
- **Optional Refinement**: Render-and-compare integration

### Design Philosophy
- **Training-Free**: Use pre-trained knowledge
- **General Purpose**: Any object, any pose
- **Practical**: Easy to deploy
- **Accurate**: Competitive with specialized methods
