## 🔧 Technical Details

### Core Innovation: Attention-based Global Alignment
```
Traditional SfM: Images → Features → Matching → RANSAC → Bundle Adjustment → 3D
Light3R-SfM: Images → Encoder → Latent Alignment → Decoder → Direct 3D
```

### Five-Stage Architecture

#### 1. Image Encoding
- **Encoder**: ViT-Large (ViT-L)
- Transform images to feature tokens
- Leverage pre-trained foundation models
- Extract rich geometric representations

#### 2. Latent Global Alignment Module
- **Architecture**: 4 attention blocks
- **Mechanism**: Self-attention + Cross-attention
- **Purpose**: Align features globally without explicit optimization
```python
# Conceptual flow
for block in range(4):
    # Global information exchange
    global_tokens = self_attention(global_tokens)
    # Propagate to image features
    image_features = cross_attention(image_features, global_tokens)
```

#### 3. Scene Graph Construction
- **Algorithm**: Shortest Path Tree (SPT)
- **Goal**: Create sparse but connected graph
- **Efficiency**: Avoids O(N²) pairwise decoding
- Select most reliable image connections

#### 4. Pairwise Pointmap Decoding
- **Decoder**: ViT-Base (ViT-B)
- Generate pointmaps only for graph edges
- Use globally aligned features from stage 2
- Maintain consistency across pairs

#### 5. Global Accumulation
- Merge pairwise predictions along spanning tree
- No optimization required
- Direct globally consistent 3D output

### Technical Specifications
- **Complexity**: O(N² + N×T) where T = tokens per image
- **Memory Scaling**: Linear with number of images
- **Foundation**: Built on DUSt3R/MASt3R pre-trained models
- **Training Data**: Waymo, CO3Dv2, MegaDepth, TartanAir
