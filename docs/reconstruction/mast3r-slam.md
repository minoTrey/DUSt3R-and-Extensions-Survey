## 📋 Overview
- **Authors**: Riku Murai, Eric Dexheimer, Andrew J. Davison
- **Institution**: Imperial College London
- **Venue**: CVPR 2025 (Highlight Paper)
- **Links**: [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11737) | [Code](https://github.com/rmurai0610/MASt3R-SLAM) | [Project Page](https://mast3r-slam.github.io/)
- **TL;DR**: First pipeline to fully integrate MASt3R's two-view 3D reconstruction priors into real-time incremental SLAM, achieving 15 FPS with globally consistent poses and dense geometry.
