   - But worse on EuRoC pose accuracy (0.041 vs 0.022)
   - Suggests dense priors help in texture-poor scenes but add noise in well-textured ones

3. **Fusion Strategy** (Table 5):
   - Weighted/Median fusion best (0.039 ATE)
   - Recent fusion worst (0.160 ATE)
   - Shows importance of temporal integration

### Limitations & Critical Analysis

#### Performance Gaps

   - 3× worse on EuRoC w/o loop closure (0.041 → 0.164)
   - Questions claim of "arbitrary camera" support

3. **Computational Cost**:
   - 2000ms for full MASt3R matching (Table 4)
   - Only achieves 15 FPS with aggressive shortcuts
   - 8-12GB GPU memory requirement
   - Not suitable for embedded devices

#### Methodological Concerns
1. **Cherry-picked Comparisons**:

   - Limited comparison with other dense methods
   - Missing runtime breakdown for full system

2. **Evaluation Limitations**:
   - Only indoor/small-scale datasets
   - No large outdoor sequences
   - No dynamic scene evaluation
   - No failure case analysis

3. **Design Contradictions**:
   - Claims "no optimization" but uses Gauss-Newton backend
   - Claims "arbitrary cameras" but needs central model
   - Claims "real-time" but requires high-end GPU

### Real-World Applicability

#### Best Use Cases
- **Controlled Indoor Environments**: Where calibration available
- **High-End Robotics**: With powerful GPUs
- **Research Platforms**: For exploring prior-based SLAM

#### Not Suitable For
- **Mobile Devices**: Too computationally intensive
- **Large-Scale Outdoor**: Memory and accuracy limitations
