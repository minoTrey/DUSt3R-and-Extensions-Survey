5. **Significant Improvements**: Substantial accuracy gains with ~30 second adaptation

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Core Innovation: Test-time Optimization
```
Given triplet (I₁, I₂, I₃):
1. Generate reconstructions:
   - R₁₂ from (I₁, I₂)
   - R₁₃ from (I₁, I₃)
2. Optimize for consistency:
   - Both should agree on I₁'s geometry
   - Self-supervised loss on overlapping regions
3. Update model via prompt tuning
```

### Architecture Adaptation
- **Base Model**: Any DUSt3R variant (MASt3R, MonST3R)
- **Adaptation Method**: Prompt tuning (efficient parameter update)
- **Training**: Self-supervised on test data
- **Memory**: Minimal additional footprint

### Optimization Strategy
- **Input**: Image triplets with shared views
- **Loss**: Geometric consistency between reconstructions
- **Time**: ~30 seconds per scene
- **Parameters**: Only prompt tokens updated

| Method | Accuracy | Consistency | Overall |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|
| DUSt3R | Good | Poor | Medium |
| MASt3R | Better | Medium | Good |
| MASt3R+Test3R | **Best** | **Best** | **Best** |

### Qualitative Improvements
- ✅ More accurate depth boundaries
- ✅ Better multi-view consistency
- ✅ Reduced depth artifacts
- ✅ Improved fine details
- ✅ Robust across different scenes

## 💡 Insights & Impact

### Why Test-time Adaptation Works

1. **Domain Gap**: Training data differs from test scenes
2. **Scene-specific Patterns**: Each scene has unique characteristics
3. **Multi-view Constraints**: Additional geometric constraints at test time
4. **Self-supervision**: No need for ground truth labels

### Technical Advantages
- **Plug-and-play**: Works with existing models
- **No Retraining**: Base model remains unchanged
- **Efficient**: Prompt tuning is lightweight
- **Generalizable**: Applicable to various architectures

### Limitations
- Requires image triplets (not pairs)
- Additional 30-second overhead
- Benefits vary by scene complexity
- May overfit to specific test scenes
